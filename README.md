# SQL-Coursework-Syracuse
Coursework done for IST 659, Data Admin Concepts and Database Management at Syracuse University. Fall quarter. Includes homework assignments and group project.

All code was written over virtual machine, so no actual files are available. Instead, there are word documents with screenshots of the code, following assignment directions.
